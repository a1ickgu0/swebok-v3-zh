|SWEBOK|Software Engineering Body of Knowledge|

Publication of the 2004 version of this Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK2004) was a major milestone in establishing software engineering as a recognized engineering discipline. The goal in developing this update to SWEBOK is to improve the currency, readability, consistency, and usability of the Guide.

All knowledge areas (KAs) have been updated to reflect changes in software engineering sincepublication of SWEBOK 2004. Four new foundation KAs and a Software Engineering ProfessionalPractices KA have been added. The Software Engineering Tools and Methods KA has been revised as Software Engineering Models and Methods. Software engineering tools is now a topic in each of the KAs. Three appendices provide the specifications for the KA description, an annotated set of relevant standards for each KA, and a listing of the references cited in the Guide.

This Guide, written under the auspices of the Professional Activities Board of the IEEE ComputerSociety, represents a next step in the evolution of the software engineering profession.

## WHAT IS SOFTWARE ENGINEERING?

ISO/IEC/IEEE Systems and Software Engineering Vocabulary (SEVOCAB) defines software engineeringas “the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software; that is, the application of engineering to software).”<sup>1</sup>

## WHAT ARE THE OBJECTIVES OF THE SWEBOK GUIDE?

The Guide should not be confused with the Body of Knowledge itself, which exists in the published literature. The purpose of the Guide is to describe the portion of the Body of Knowledge that is generallyaccepted, to organize that portion, and to provide topical access to it.

The Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK Guide) was established with the following five objectives:

1. To promote a consistent view of software engineering worldwide2. To specify the scope of, and clarify the place of software engineering with respect to other disciplines such as computer science, project management, computer engineering, and mathematics 
3. To characterize the contents of the software engineering discipline4. To provide a topical access to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge5. To provide a foundation for curriculum development and for individual certification and licensing material


The first of these objectives, a consistent worldwide view of software engineering, was supportedby a development process which engaged approximately 150 reviewers from 33 countries. More information regarding the development process can be found on the website ([www.swebok.org](http://www.swebok.org/)). Professional and learned societies and public agencies involved in software engineering were contacted, made aware of this project to update SWEBOK, and invited to participate in the review process. KA editors were recruited from North America, the Pacific Rim, and Europe. Presentations on the project were made at various international venues.
The second of the objectives, the desire to specify the scope of software engineering, motivatesthe fundamental organization of the Guide. The material that is recognized as being within this discipline is organized into the fifteen KAs listed in Table I.1. Each of these KAs is treated in a chapter in this Guide.

| Table I.1. The 15 SWEBOK KAs |
|---||Software Requirements||Software Design||Software Construction||Software Testing||Software Maintenance||Software Configuration Management||Software Engineering Management||Software Engineering Process||Software Engineering Models and Methods||Software Quality||Software Engineering Professional Practice||Software Engineering Economics||Computing Foundations||Mathematical Foundations||Engineering Foundations|

In specifying scope, it is also important to identify the disciplines that intersect with software engineering. To this end, SWEBOK V3 also recognizes seven related disciplines, listed in Table I.2. Software engineers should, of course, have knowledge of material from these disciplines (and the KA descriptions in this Guide may make reference to them). It is not, however, an objective of the SWEBOK Guide to characterize the knowledge of the related disciplines.

## HIERARCHICAL ORGANIZATION

The organization of the KA chapters supports the third of the project’s objectives—a characterization of the contents of software engineering. The detailed specifications provided by the project’s editorial team to the associate editors regarding the contents of the KA descriptions can be found in Appendix A.


The Guide uses a hierarchical organization to decompose each KA into a set of topics with recognizable labels. A two (sometime three) level breakdown provides a reasonable way to find topics of interest. The Guide treats the selected topics in a manner compatible with major schools of thought and with breakdowns generally found in industry and in software engineering literature and standards. The breakdowns of topics do not presume particular application domains, business uses, management philosophies, development methods, and so forth. The extent of each topic’s description is only that needed to understand the generally accepted nature of the topics and for the reader to successfully find reference material; the Body of Knowledge is found in the reference materials themselves, not in the Guide.

## REFERENCE MATERIAL AND MATRIX

To provide topical access to the knowledge—the fourth of the project’s objectives—the Guide identifies authoritative reference material for each KA. Appendix C provides a Consolidated Reference List for the Guide. Each KA includes relevant references from the Consolidated Reference List and also includes a matrix relating the reference material to the included topics.

It should be noted that the Guide does not attempt to be comprehensive in its citations. Much material that is both suitable and excellent is not referenced. Material included in the Consolidated Reference List provides coverage of the topics described.

## DEPTH OF TREATMENT

To achieve the SWEBOK fifth objective—providing a foundation for curriculum development, certification, and licensing, the criterion of generally accepted knowledge has been applied, to be distinguished from advanced and research knowledge (on the grounds of maturity) and from specialized knowledge (on the grounds of generality of application).

The equivalent term generally recognized comes from the Project Management Institute:“Generally recognized means the knowledge and practices described are applicable to mostprojects most of the time, and there is consensus about their value and usefulness.”<sup>2</sup>

However, the terms “generally accepted” or “generally recognized” do not imply that the designatedknowledge should be uniformly applied to all software engineering endeavors—each project’s needs determine that—but it does imply that competent, capable software engineers should be equipped with this knowledge for potential application. More precisely, generally accepted knowledge should be included in the study materialfor the software engineering licensing examination that graduates would take after gaining four years of work experience. Although this criterion is specific to the US style of education and does not necessarily apply to other countries, we deem it useful.

## STRUCTURE OF THE KA DESCRIPTIONS

The KA descriptions are structured as follows.

In the introduction, a brief definition of the KA and an overview of its scope and of its relationship with other KAs are presented.

The breakdown of topics in each KA constitutes the core the KA description, describing the decomposition of the KA into subareas, topics, and sub-topics. For each topic or subtopic, a short description is given, along with one or more references.

The reference material was chosen because it is considered to constitute the best presentation ofthe knowledge relative to the topic. A matrix links the topics to the reference material.

The last part of each KA description is the list of recommended references and (optionally) furtherreadings. Relevant standards for each KA are presented in Appendix B of the Guide.

## APPENDIX A. KA DESCRIPTION SPECIFICATIONS

Appendix A describes the specifications provided by the editorial team to the associate editors for the content, recommended references, format, and style of the KA descriptions.

## APPENDIX B. ALLOCATION OF STANDARDS TO KAS

Appendix B is an annotated list of the relevant standards, mostly from the IEEE and the ISO, for each of the KAs of the SWEBOK Guide.

## APPENDIX C. CONSOLIDATED REFERENCE LIST

Appendix C contains the consolidated list of recommended references cited in the KAs (these references are marked with an asterisk (*) in the text).
